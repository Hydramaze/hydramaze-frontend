    <h3>Problem Introduction</h3>
    <p>Imagine that you are a house seller and you already have a table with some features about the houses. Take a look on the table below:</p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>#</th>
          <th>House Size</th>
          <th>Nº Bedrooms</th>
          <th>Nº bathrooms</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">1</th>
          <td>300 sqft</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$37,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">2</th>
          <td>920 sqft</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$235,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">3</th>
          <td>1,389 sqft</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$157,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">4</th>
          <td>1,976 sqft</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>$164,900</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">5</th>
          <td>3,789 sqft</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$1,430,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">6</th>
          <td>1,400 sqft</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$59,900</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">7</th>
          <td>1,301 sqft</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>$159,900</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">8</th>
          <td>972 sqft</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>$1,500,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">9</th>
          <td>2,158 sqft</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>$899,000</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now you have been asked to estimate a price to a new house which has the following features:</p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>#</th>
          <th>House Size</th>
          <th>Nº Bedrooms</th>
          <th>Nº bathrooms</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">9</th>
          <td>672 sqft</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>So how can we solve this problem? Let's try to use a machine learning to help us!</p>
  <p>At this point you probably know that we have some algorithms that could be used. Then which of them we have to choose?</p>
  <p>Let's try to use a Linear Regression! Go to the next step.</p>
